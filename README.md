Introduction
This repository contains the code for a deep learning model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal of this project is to create an accurate classifier that distinguishes between these two classes of images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is downloaded directly from the FreeCodeCamp dataset for Cats and Dogs. It consists of training, validation, and test images organized into directories.

To download and unzip the dataset:

python
Copy code
!wget https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip
!unzip cats_and_dogs.zip
The directory structure after extraction looks like this:

bash
Copy code
cats_and_dogs/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── cats/
    │   └── dogs/
    ├── validation/
    │   ├── cats/
    │   └── dogs/
    └── test/
The total number of files in each directory is calculated as follows:

python
Copy code
import os

PATH = 'cats_and_dogs'

train_dir = os.path.join(PATH, 'train')
validation_dir = os.path.join(PATH, 'validation')
test_dir = os.path.join(PATH, 'test')

total_train = sum([len(files) for r, d, files in os.walk(train_dir)])
total_val = sum([len(files) for r, d, files in os.walk(validation_dir)])
total_test = len(os.listdir(test_dir))

print(f"Total Training Images: {total_train}")
print(f"Total Validation Images: {total_val}")
print(f"Total Test Images: {total_test}")
Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of the following layers:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
Fully connected layers (Dense layers) for classification
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
The input images are resized to 150x150 pixels.

Training
The model is trained with the following hyperparameters:

Batch size: 128
Epochs: 50
Image Height: 150 pixels
Image Width: 150 pixels
To ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data, a separate validation set is used during training.

python
Copy code
batch_size = 128
epochs = 50
IMG_HEIGHT = 150
IMG_WIDTH = 150
The training is performed on the dataset using TensorFlow, with data augmentation and image pre-processing applied.

Results
After training the model for 50 epochs, the accuracy and loss are evaluated on the test set. The model achieves a high accuracy of X% on the test data.
